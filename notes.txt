1. To run the vite project: npm run dev
2. Basename meaning in BrowserRouter -> 
if basename = '/' then all the routers further created for specific routing will first start with / and then the remaning router name.
for eg: if we are creating users page/route then the route will start with: "/users" like this.
if we create a route/page named as login then: "/login" 
if by name connections then: "/connections".
so basically basename acts as a base start for further routers.
